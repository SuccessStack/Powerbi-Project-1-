# üì¶ Monthly Sales and Price Analysis | Power BI Dashboard

Welcome to the **Monthly Sales and Price Analysis** project! This interactive dashboard was built using **Power BI** to analyze a detailed dataset from a fictional retail supply chain. The goal is to extract actionable business insights and showcase how data visualization can support decision-making in sectors like food distribution, utilities, and transportation.

## üîç Project Objective

The main aim of this project is to explore monthly sales and pricing trends across several product categories and suppliers, while uncovering key metrics such as:

- Sales performance over time  
- Category-wise revenue contribution  
- Supplier impact on total revenue  
- Price fluctuations across months and products  
- Geographic distribution of goods sold  

This project can support inventory managers, financial analysts, and business executives in identifying trends, planning procurement, and optimizing pricing strategies.
